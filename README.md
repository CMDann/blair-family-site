The Blair surname is of great antiquity, first appearing in Scotland in the 12th and early 13th centuries. The "word" Blair is strongly believed to be territorial in origin, being derived from the Gaelic "Blar" which signifies a field clear of woods or a battlefield. From this, the "name" Blair takes on its territorial connotation. The very early records tell us that "Blair" was originally spelled "Blare" and that there followed a gradual transition to "Blair", completed around 1400. Today, we know of no one using the original Blare spelling.
